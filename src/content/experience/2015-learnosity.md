Worked with a small start-up and helped grow the company into a global player in the e-learning industry. Specialising in web applications and APIs. Learnosity is an agile web based company that provides a toolkit for publishers to move into online assessment. I built a number of assessment UI widgets, as well as took on the responsibility of being the lead on two of their authoring tools: the Question Editor API and Learnosity Author.

Leading a team of 4 my role was to ensure the team was following good SDLC and agile development practices. Liaising with the team of designers to ensure we had complete specifications. Making decisions on the appropriate web technologies, and working with the QA team to make sure we were adhering to strict software testing standards.
