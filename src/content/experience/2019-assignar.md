Joined a small team of developers working on mobile and web applications for a start-up specialising in operations management software for the construction industry. During this time I introduced React componentry, open source methodologies and improved build tooling. As the business grew rapidly my previous start-up experience was invaluable to helping the product grow and for the team to adopt good software life-cycle standards (Scrum), configuring Atlassian's JIRA for company wide use.

I later took on the responsibility of leading a team of 5 including 1 working remotely to build a work scheduling web application. I ensured the team worked closely with the design and QA teams to deliver clear specifications whilst also adhering to strict software testing standards.
