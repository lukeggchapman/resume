Currently working at a late stage debt collection start up. I've gained valuable experience in event sourcing while working with an AWS golang microservice lambda architecture at scale. This has presented unique challenges leveraging my expertise with observing serverless infrastructure. There has also been exposure to trunk based development, mob, and pair programming with remote first teams.
This is largest sized company I've worked with in over a decade and I was able to gain an understanding of the domain quickly and start applying value. I've since been promoted to an engineering lead, where I play a role in organising and communicating across the 200 employees to ensure the team is delivering value.
