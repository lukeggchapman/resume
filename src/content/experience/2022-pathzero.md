Joined the co-founders as the first employee and software engineer to create a carbon accounting web application. My responsibilities included managing the AWS infrastructure using Terraform, and leading all backend development of RESTful and GraphQL APIs built with Node.JS and AWS lambda. The platform required rapid iterations while delivering precise carbon measurements, this was achieved by adhering to stringent quality controls including static, unit and integration tests. The result was being able to deliver value consistently and to a high quality standard during the changing priorities of an early stage start-up

As the team grew I moved into a leadership role where my responsibilities expanded to interviewing and assessing new hires, onboarding new employees, and planning new projects.
