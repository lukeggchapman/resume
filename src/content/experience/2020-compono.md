Joined a HR software product start-up where I was part of a small agile team that assisted on many different projects during a period of rapid growth. Contributed to all of their many products and gained experience working on microservice kubernetes architecture hosted on GCP. My responsibilities as a senior member of a small team was to uphold industry standards and push forward the technical direction of the team. I was also part of the technical advisory board where we discussed architectural decisions that affected all teams in the engineering department. My extensive experience with Typescript, GraphQL, React, Node.JS and end-to-end testing allowed me to make impactful contributions across the full-stack.
