Joined a HR software product start-up where I was part of a small agile team that was moved around week-on-week to assist the other teams during a period of rapid growth. Contributed to all of their many products and gained experience working on microservice kubernetes architecture hosted on GCP. My responsibilities included being on the company wide technical advisory board where we discussed architectural decisions. My extensive experience with Typescript, GraphQL, React, Node.JS and end-to-end testing allowed me to make impactful contributions across the full-stack.
