I was the only software engineer in a small team working to create a music festival that happened many times over a 9 year period growing to a size of around 6,000 attendees. My responsibilities included:

- Building the website alongside a designer, recreating it each year.
- Building an application forms platform.
- Building the online ticket sales platform.
- Managing all online infrastructure in Amazon AWS.
- Creating software and hardware solutions for running the gate at the festival.
- Supplying internet coverage to the festival in remote NSW Australia.
