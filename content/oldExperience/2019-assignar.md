Assignar is operations management software for the construction industry. My role was to work on the mobile and web applications. During this time I introduced React modules, open source methodologies and improved build tooling.
My experience at previous start-ups was invaluable to helping the product grow and the team to adopt good software life-cycle standards.

Took on the responsibility of leading a team of five including one working remotely to build a work scheduling web application for Assignar's administrating platform.
During this time I helped the company adopt scrum methods and configured Atlassian's JIRA for company wide use. I worked closely with the design team to deliver clear specifications for the new product, and worked alongside the QA lead to ensure we were adhering to strict software testing standards.
