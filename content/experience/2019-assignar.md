Took on the responsibility of leading a team of five including one working remotely to build a work scheduling web application for Assignar's administrating platform.
During this time I helped the company adopt scrum methods and configured Atlassian's JIRA for company wide use. I worked closely with the design team to deliver clear specifications for the new product, and worked alongside the QA lead to ensure we were adhering to strict software testing standards.
