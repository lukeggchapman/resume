I was a software engineer working with a small team working to create a music festival that happened many times over a 9 year period growing to a size of around 6,000 attendees.

My responsibilities included:

- building the website alongside a designer, recreating it each year.
- building an application forms platform.
- building the online ticket sales platform.
- managing all online infrastructure in Amazon AWS.
- creating software and hardware solutions for running the gate at the festival.
- supplying internet coverage to the festival in remote NSW Australia.
- managing all email accounts (Fastmail) for the various team members over the years.

The online platform was recreated many times by me over the years, starting first with Python and Django, then migrating to Drupal, then to a custom CMS in Node.js.

The festival gate system evolved as well, starting as printed lists of peoples email with name and address to be matched to their license, to a printed QR code to be read from first a mobile phone application (PhoneGap), and then later with specialised bar-code readers attached to laptop terminals connected to a local DB.

Internet was provided to the remote location by way of putting a 4G antenna on a hill attached to a router running off a battery and solar panel combo. The signal was then sent on as WiFi using Ubiquiti NanoStations 1km down the hill to the festival HQ.
