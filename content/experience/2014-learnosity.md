Worked with a small start-up and helped grow the company into a global player in the e-learning industry. Specialising in web applications and APIs. Learnosity is an agile web based company that provides a toolkit for publishers to move into online assessment. I built a number of Questions API UI widgets, as well as took on the responsibility of being the lead on two of their authoring tools: the Question Editor API and the Author API.

The web technologies used were primarily based on Javascript and included backbone.js, require.js and SCSS. I worked closely with a designer to produce finished results from mock-ups that create a clean UX friendly result. Iâ€™ve also gained experience with GIT source control, Scrum, PHP frameworks (Slim, Symfony 2), Grunt and testing tools such as Karma, Mocha, Jasmine, Selenium and more.
