Worked with a small start-up and helped grow the company into a global player in the e-learning industry. Specialising in web applications and APIs. Learnosity is an agile web based company that provides a toolkit for publishers to move into online assessment. I built a number of Questions API UI widgets, as well as took on the responsibility of being the lead on two of their authoring tools: the Question Editor API and the Author API.

The web technologies used were primarily based on Javascript and included backbone.js, require.js and SCSS. I worked closely with a designer to produce finished results from mock-ups that create a clean UX friendly result. Iâ€™ve also gained experience with GIT source control, Scrum, PHP frameworks (Slim, Symfony 2), Grunt and testing tools such as Karma, Mocha, Jasmine, Selenium and more.

I was the software development team leader for a greenfield project now called "Learnosity Author".
Leading a team of 4 we were responsible for creating a front end web application that made use of our other products to allow users to author online assessments.
My role as the team leader was to ensure the team was following good SDLC and agile development practices. Liaising with the team of designers to ensure we had complete specifications. Making decisions on the appropriate web technologies, and working with the QA team to make sure we were adhering to our software testing standards.
