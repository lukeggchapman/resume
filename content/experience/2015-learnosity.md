I was the software development team leader for a greenfield project now called "Learnosity Author".
Leading a team of 4 we were responsible for creating a front end web application that made use of our other products to allow users to author online assessments.
My role as the team leader was to ensure the team was following good SDLC and agile development practices. Liaising with the team of designers to ensure we had complete specifications. Making decisions on the appropriate web technologies, and working with the QA team to make sure we were adhering to our software testing standards.
